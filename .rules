# Coding guidelines

* Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
* Do not write organizational or comments that summarize the code. Comments should only be written in order to explain "why" the code is written in some way in the case there is a reason that is tricky / non-obvious.
* Prefer implementing functionality in existing files unless it is a new logical component. Avoid creating many small files.
* Be careful with operations like indexing which may panic if the indexes are out of bounds.
* When implementing async operations that may fail, ensure errors propagate to the users as meaningful feedback.
